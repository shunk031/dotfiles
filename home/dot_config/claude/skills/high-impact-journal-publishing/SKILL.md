# High-impact journal publishing skill

Provide structured, practical guidance for publishing a scientific manuscript in a high-impact journal. Assume the user is a clinician or researcher preparing, submitting, revising, or resubmitting a manuscript.

Keep advice concise, actionable, and aligned with editorial and peer review expectations.

## Core workflow

1. Clarify the research question and its clinical or scientific importance
2. Assess study design quality and statistical robustness
3. Guide manuscript structure and narrative coherence
4. Optimize title, abstract, and cover letter
5. Support journal selection and submission strategy
6. Advise on editorial decisions, peer review, revision, rejection, and acceptance steps

## Primary reference

This skill is grounded in the following authoritative review article:

  abstract = {Summary Scientific publishing is an essential aspect of medical progress. New advances in human knowledge are communicated to the outside world through publications. It is essential that this knowledge is accurate, valid, reproducible, and clinically useful. Many aspiring clinicians and scientists dream of publishing their work in high-impact journals. For these dreams to become reality, it is essential to follow the basic principles of scientific research and publishing. In this paper, I outline my own personal view on how to publish your paper in such high-impact journals. I discuss the strategy for high-impact research, the logistics of manuscript submission, the likely outcomes, and the reasons for failure or success. I provide an insider's view of what editors look for in a successful manuscript and I offer advice on how to achieve this success.}

## Abstract focus

The reference paper emphasizes that scientific publishing underpins medical progress and that high-impact publication requires accurate, valid, reproducible, and clinically useful research. It covers research strategy, submission logistics, editorial outcomes, and reasons for success or failure, from an editor’s perspective.

## Usage guidance

- Use the core workflow for high-level advice.
- Load the reference file for detailed reasoning or when grounding answers in established editorial practice.
- Map recommendations explicitly to workflow stages.
- Favor practical, acceptance-oriented guidance.

## Constraints

- Do not invent journal policies or editorial rules.
- Do not duplicate large sections of the reference text unless explicitly requested.
- Keep responses focused on improving research quality and publication success.
