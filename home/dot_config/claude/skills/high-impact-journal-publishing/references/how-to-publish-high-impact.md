## Summary

Scientific publishing is an essential aspect of medical progress. New advances in human knowledge are communicated to the outside world through publications. It is essential that this knowledge is accurate, valid, reproducible, and clinically useful. Many aspiring clinicians and scientists dream of publishing their work in high-impact journals. For these dreams to become reality, it is essential to follow the basic principles of scientific research and publishing. In this paper, I outline my own personal view on how to publish your paper in such high-impact journals. I discuss the strategy for high-impact research, the logistics of manuscript submission, the likely outcomes, and the reasons for failure or success. I provide an insider's view of what editors look for in a successful manuscript and I offer advice on how to achieve this success.

## Introduction

Journals are the custodians of scientific endeavor and advancement. They aim to publish sound research with enduring conclusions that will stand careful scrutiny and validation. As such, they are always seeking to publish material that has an impact on the scientific and medical community. Key elements of this work are novelty and the potential for stimulating further discussion and research. As aspiring authors, your aim is to produce such a document. Therefore, to produce a high-quality scientific paper, high-quality research must be performed. In reality, this is not as simple as it sounds. Some essential requirements are needed to achieve success. Even the most experienced researchers sometimes overlook these essential requirements and the output often ends up in lower-tier journals. In the following section, I have outlined the essential requirements for a solid high-impact publication.

## Do good research

What are the essential requirements for good research? For aspiring young clinician-scientists, it is essential to choose a good unit with a good mentor. Mentors are essential in guiding us through the maze of scientific folly, pitfalls, and dead ends. They inspire us to find the best within us, keep us focused, and ensure delivery of success. When setting out to research a particular topic, it is essential to read the literature and master what has already been completed previously. There is no reward in reinventing the wheel.

## Formulate an important research question

Generally speaking, and for clinician-scientists, the research question has to stem from a clinically important topic that has a significant disease burden in the society in question. It is therefore best to avoid rare diseases, which are better researched in bigger and more established units with plenty of research support. Choose a research-active area where there are new ideas, methods, and sufficient grant funding. Aim to define mechanisms rather than perform purely descriptive confirmatory research. Choose a topic where local expertise is available for support when difficulties arise.

## Do not work alone because this is self-defeating and will likely produce poor quality research output

Collaboration with national and international groups should be considered. Multicenter studies have greater impact and validity and improve the chances of publication in higher-tier journals.

## Sound study design

The most important aspect of any research study is its design. This must be as close to perfect as possible from the outset. If the design is defective, it cannot be fixed at the writing stage. Editors and reviewers assess study design as the first criterion. Inappropriate controls and underpowered studies are common reasons for failure. Healthy volunteers should be used as controls whenever possible, and patients and controls should be matched for age and sex. Mechanistic studies are preferred over purely observational ones. Involving a statistician early is essential. A primary endpoint must be defined in advance, with appropriate power calculations. If variability is unknown, a pilot study may be required.

## Writing your manuscript

Scientific writing is storytelling with logic and clarity. A manuscript should have a clear beginning, middle, and end with a clear take-home message. Readers want to know what was done, why it was done, what was found, and what it means. Good writing requires clarity, brevity, and logical flow. Each paragraph should stand alone while fitting into the overall narrative. Use simple language, correct grammar, and avoid irrelevant information. Include only data directly related to the scientific question.

Most journals require a rigid structure and strict adherence to author instructions. Failure to follow these instructions leads to delays and rejection. The standard structure includes Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgements, References, Tables, and Figures.

## Before you submit

You have only one chance to attract the editor’s attention. Careless errors can be fatal. Asking a nonspecialist colleague to review the manuscript can improve readability and logic. Particular attention should be paid to the title, abstract, and cover letter.

## The importance of the title

The title is the first point of contact for readers. It should be concise, accurate, and engaging. A good title conveys the main topic and importance of the findings without being overly long or vague. Draft multiple options and refine them with colleague feedback.

## The abstract

The abstract often determines whether a paper is read or reviewed. It must stand alone and answer key questions: what was done, why it was done, what was found, and why it matters. Most journals limit abstracts to around 250 words, and journal-specific formatting must be followed.

## Writing a cover letter to the editor-in-chief

The cover letter is your opportunity to sell the paper. It must be accurate, professional, and tailored to the journal. Address the editor-in-chief by name, highlight novelty and relevance, and explain why the work fits the journal’s scope. Avoid repeating the abstract. Include confirmation that the manuscript is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and approved by all authors.

## Choosing a journal: Be honest about the quality of your own work

Selecting the right journal is difficult and requires honest self-assessment. High-impact journals prioritize novelty, impact, and priority. Confirmatory or incremental studies are less attractive. Feedback from conference presentations can help gauge impact. While cascading submissions is common, accurately targeting the appropriate journal from the outset is often more efficient. Check the journal’s aims and scope carefully, and consider presubmission inquiries when appropriate.

## Logistics of manuscript submission and editorial handling

Strict adherence to submission instructions is essential. Do not submit to multiple journals simultaneously. After submission, manuscripts are screened for compliance, then assessed by the editor-in-chief and associate editors. Manuscripts may be rejected without external review or sent for peer review if deemed suitable.

## Reasons for an instant rejection

Common reasons include lack of fit with the journal, lack of novelty, descriptive rather than mechanistic research, uninteresting questions, and poor or underpowered study design.

## External peer review

Only a small proportion of manuscripts are sent for external peer review in high-impact journals. Possible outcomes include rejection, major revision, or minor revision and acceptance. Acceptance without revision is rare. Rejection may occur due to design flaws, lack of novelty, unclear message, small effect size, confusing figures, or inconsistencies in data presentation.

## You receive a major revise decision—what next?

A major revision means the manuscript has potential. Reviewer comments should be addressed fully and respectfully. Reviewers should be seen as collaborators, not adversaries. Disagreements should be expressed politely and clearly. Provide additional data where possible and explain transparently when requests cannot be fulfilled. Revised manuscripts should clearly indicate changes and responses.

## What do you do if your manuscript is rejected?

Rejection often triggers strong emotions, but a calm and objective response is essential. Reviewer comments should be assessed carefully. If a clear error is identified and supported by evidence, a rebuttal may be considered, though success is rare. More commonly, revising the manuscript and submitting to another journal is the best course. Address all previous weaknesses before resubmission.

## What do you do if the manuscript is accepted?

After acceptance, copyright and conflict-of-interest forms must be completed. Proofs should be reviewed carefully within tight deadlines to catch production errors. References should be updated. Once finalized, the manuscript is published online with a DOI, which serves as proof of publication.

## Summary and conclusions

Publishing in a high-impact journal requires an important question, strong study design, rigorous execution, clear writing, appropriate journal selection, and respectful engagement with reviewers. The process is demanding, but successful publication is highly rewarding and contributes meaningfully to scientific progress.

## Conflicts of interest

The author declares no conflicts of interest.
