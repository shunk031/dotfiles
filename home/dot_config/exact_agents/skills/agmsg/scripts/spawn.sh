# @file scripts/spawn.sh
# @brief Launch a new agent process and have it take an actas identity.
# @description
#   Given an agent type and an actas name, this script pre-joins the name to a
#   team for the target project, opens a tmux or terminal placement, and starts
#   the agent CLI with `/agmsg actas <name>` as its initial prompt.
#
# @example
#   spawn.sh <agent-type> <name> [options]
#   spawn.sh <agent-type> <name> --boot-prompt "<initial task>" [options]
#
# @arg $1 agent-type Any registered spawnable type with a direct CLI or node launcher.
# @arg $2 name Actas identity for the spawned agent.
# @option --boot-prompt <text> An initial task for the spawned agent. When given, the
#                      boot prompt becomes the actas slash command followed
#                      (newline-separated) by <text>, so the new agent claims
#                      its identity AND acts on the task in its first turn —
#                      handy for a codex peer (no Monitor), where a message
#                      sent after spawn would never reach the idle session.
#                      An empty string (`--boot-prompt ""`) means no task.
# @option --project <path> Project to launch in (default: $PWD).
# @option --team <team> Team to join <name> into (default: auto-resolved from
#                      the project's existing registrations; required when the
#                      project belongs to more than one team).
# @option --window Open a new tmux WINDOW instead of splitting the pane.
# @option --split h|v Tmux split direction when splitting the current window.
# @option --terminal <tmpl> Terminal command template for the non-tmux path; a
#                      `{cmd}` placeholder is replaced with the path to the
#                      generated boot script (an executable file the terminal
#                      should run). Overrides $AGMSG_TERMINAL and config
#                      `spawn.terminal`.
# @option --no-wait Do not block on the readiness handshake after launch.
# @option --ready-timeout N Seconds to wait for readiness before giving up.
# @option --model <id> Launch the agent on a specific model. The id is passed
#                      through to the CLI unchecked (the CLI rejects unknown
#                      ids); the flag spelling comes from the type's manifest
#                      `model_arg=`. Refused for a type with no model_arg.
# @option --cli-arg <token> Append one extra CLI token for a direct-CLI launch. May
#                      be repeated. Tokens are injected after spawn-options and
#                      before the initial prompt. Refused for node launchers.
#
# Spawn options: extra CLI args to always pass a given type's launched
# binary (e.g. a default permission mode or sandbox policy), configured
# per-type in a YAML file rather than hardcoded — see
# scripts/lib/spawn-options.sh. File: $AGMSG_SPAWN_OPTIONS_FILE, else
# ~/.agmsg/config/spawn_options.yaml. Optional; a missing file/section is a
# no-op.
#
# Readiness: by default spawn blocks until the new agent's watcher attaches and
# is receiving (it prints `status=ready ...`), so a leader can safely send work
# right after spawn returns without racing the agent's cold start. Codex has no
# Monitor, so the wait is skipped for codex.
#
# Scope note: spawnable types are those whose manifest declares `spawnable=yes`;
# macOS is the primary target, Linux and
# Windows are best-effort (no guarantee — please open an issue/PR if a given
# terminal does not work). Headless environments (no tmux and no usable
# terminal) error out, because the agent CLIs need an interactive terminal.

# across tmux, macOS, Linux emulators, Windows Terminal, and custom templates,
# and on macOS it lets us use `open -a` (a plain app launch) instead of
# `osascript ... do script`, which goes through AppleEvents and triggers the
# Automation (TCC) permission prompts users otherwise have to approve.
#
# The agent CLIs accept an initial prompt as a positional argument and submit
# it as the session's first message; passing the slash command makes the new
# agent run `/agmsg actas <name>` on boot. We cd into the project first so a
# cross-project spawn lands in the right tree, and drop into an interactive
# shell afterwards so the window/pane stays open with the agent's final output.
# The slash command is named after the installed command, which the user may
# have customized at install time (install.sh --cmd). Derive it from the skill
# dir basename so a custom install (e.g. `/m`) spawns `/m actas <name>` rather
# than a nonexistent `/agmsg actas <name>`.
