# Herdr Tab Status

The worker owns its current tab and follows the `herdr` skill to rename it whenever the progress state changes, including entering or leaving a retry. The leading emoji is the primary signal because the task label may be truncated. Put status only in the tab label; keep workspace and worktree labels emoji-free.

`🚧`, `✅`, and `⛔` apply only to worker tabs. When the current agent is the orchestrator, preserve or set `🤖 Orchestrator` according to `shunk031-orchestrate-herdr-workers`; never replace it with a worker status while routing work.

Use exactly these states:

- `🚧 <current step>` means work is actively progressing, including a live retry or diagnostic run.
- `⛔ <next action>` means the worker cannot progress or close: it is waiting for an answer, review, approval, or merge; an external dependency blocks it; or it was stopped/superseded and awaits handoff or cleanup.
- `✅ <task> <PR number>` means worker work and the required handoff are complete, with no action remaining.

A published but open PR with DONE reported is still blocked while review or merge is user-only; keep the worker's `⛔` next-action label until that action resolves, then use completion only when no action remains. The worker renames its own tab. The orchestrator may set the blocked label only for a silent or dead worker and must not change another live worker's tab during normal work. A completion label always keeps a concise task and PR number, never a generic `DONE`.

When asked to choose a label, put the literal label on the first line, then explain it.

For a BLOCKED report, the worker renames its own tab before reporting:

```text
herdr tab rename "$HERDR_TAB_ID" "⛔ <next action>"
herdr agent prompt <orchestrator> "BLOCKED <worker>: <reason>"
```

The `BLOCKED` reason must state why the worker cannot progress or close, such as an unavailable external dependency or stopped/superseded handoff.

Follow the `herdr` skill's Herdr-environment and current-tab safety requirements before issuing tab commands.
